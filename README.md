# android-starter

This is Android Starter Application. The purpose of this project is to have few templates, that are going to minimize the work when creating new applications. There are several templates, both in Kotlin and Java, and hopefully you will find your desired template here. When i say template, i mean more of configuration template, because there are no screens implemented, just some default stuff that i was using in almost all the projects.
